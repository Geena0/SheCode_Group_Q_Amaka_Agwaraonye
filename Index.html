<p id="list"> ☛Annette Claire Baier (11 October 1929 – 2 November 2012)was a New Zealand philosopher and Hume scholar, who was focused in particular on Hume's moral psychology. <br><br>

    ☛ She was also a feminist philosopher and was well known for her contributions to philosophy of mind.<br><br>
    ☛ Baier earned bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of Otago in her native Dunedin, New Zealand.<br><br>
    ☛ In 1952, she went to Somerville College, Oxford, where she earned her PhD and met fellow philosophers Philippa Foot and G.E.M. Anscombe.<br><br>
    ☛ For most of her career she taught in the philosophy department at the University of Pittsburgh, having moved there from Carnegie Mellon University. She retired to Dunedin.<br><br>
    ☛ She was former President of the Eastern Division of the American Philosophical Association, an office reserved for the elite of her profession.<br><br>
    ☛  Baier received an honorary Doctor of Literature from the University of Otago in 1999.<br><br>

    ☛She was one of the feminist philosophers who believed that women have their own version of morality and there is need to have that version of morality tolorated like the version of men.<br><br>

    ☛One of her views in ethics is that men and women make their decisions about right and wrong based on differnt value systems.<br><br>

    ☛Annette Claire Baier also analyzes "trust" from a different perspective in her book "Moral Prejudices". She got the inspiration to write "Moral Prejudices" from Hume's unfinished work; "Of Moral Prejudices".<br><br>

    ☛ Baier made a start on trust on the interpersonal level, in contrast to earlier moral philosophers who focused on explicit terms(contract) when discusssing trust. She defined trust as reliance on one's good but not expected ill-will. For Baier, trust comes with vulnerability and it is unavoidable.<br><br>
    ☛ She became famous as a moral philosopher, a Hume scholar and a feminist, with books such as Postures of the Mind: Essays on Mind and Morals (1985), A Progress of Sentiments: Reflections on Hume's Treatise (1991), Moral Prejudices (1995) (including the essays ‘What Do Women Want in an Ethical Theory?’ and ‘The Need For More Than Justice’) and The Commons of the Mind (1997).

<p id="quote"><strong>“Trust is a notoriously vulnerable good, easily wounded and not at all easily healed.
    Trust is not always a good, to be preserved. There must be some worthwhile enterprise in which the trusting and trusted parties are involved, some good bread being kneaded, for trust to be a good thing. If the enterprise is evil, a producer of poisons, then the trust that improves its workings will also be evil, and decent people will want to destroy, not to protect, that form of trust.
    A death squad may consist of wholly trustworthy and, for a while at least, sensibly trusting coworkers. So the first thing to be checked, if our trust is to become self-conscious, is the nature of the enterprise whose workings are smoothed by merited trust.”
    ― Annette Baier</strong></p>
